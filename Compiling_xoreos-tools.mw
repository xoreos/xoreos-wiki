This page gives a few tips and pointers on how to compile xoreos-tools on various platforms.
__TOC__

==Compiler and build system==

xoreos-tools is written in C++, so a C++ compiler, like [https://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] or [http://clang.llvm.org/ clang] is required. xoreos-tools follows the C++11 standard. It has two build systems: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system Autotools] ([https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ Autoconf], [https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/ Automake] and [https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ Libtool]) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake CMake]. Use whichever you feel more comfortable with.

===GNU/Linux===

On Debian-based distributions (including Ubuntu), you should be able to install the required compiler and build system packages with

 <nowiki>apt-get install libc6-dev g++ make autoconf automake libtool gettext</nowiki>

On Arch Linux, you can install the necessary packages with

 <nowiki>sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake</nowiki>

On other distributions, it should work similarily.

===Windows===

Since Visual Studio does not work with autotools, you have to use the CMake build system if you want to compile xoreos with Visual Studio. If you're using [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW], however, you're free to choose either build system.

On Windows, it is recommended that instead of Visual Studio, you use [https://msys2.github.io/ MSYS2] together with [https://mingw-w64.org/ Mingw-w64] (which can produce both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries). MSYS2 provides a package manager, with which you can install xoreos' library dependencies very easily.

You can install the 32-bit toolchain in MSYS2 with

 <nowiki>pacman -S base-devel git mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-cmake</nowiki>

You can install the 64-bit toolchain in MSYS2 with

 <nowiki>pacman -S base-devel git mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake</nowiki>

==Libraries==

xoreos-tools uses the following libraries to function:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconv iconv]
* [http://www.zlib.net/ zlib] (>= 1.2.3.4)
* [http://www.xmlsoft.org/ libxml2] (>= 2.8.0)
* [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] (>= 1.53.0)
** Boost.Utility
** Boost.StringAlgo
** Boost.System
** Boost.Filesystem
** Boost.Regex
** Boost.Hash
** Boost.Function
** Boost.Bind
** Boost.Uuid
** Boost.Smart_Ptr
** Boost.ScopeExit
** Boost.Atomic
** Boost.Locale

On Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution (including Ubuntu), you should be able to install these libraries and their development packages with

 apt-get install zlib1g-dev libxml2-dev libboost-all-dev

On Arch Linux, you can install these dependencies with

 sudo pacman -S zlib libxml2 boost boost-libs

Other GNU/Linux distributions should work similarily.

On Windows, if you're using MSYS2, you can install these dependencies for 32-bit with

  pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-zlib mingw-w64-i686-libxml2 mingw-w64-i686-boost

On Windows, if you're using MSYS2, you can install these dependencies for 64-bit with

  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib mingw-w64-x86_64-libxml2 mingw-w64-x86_64-boost

Windows users not using MSYS2 will have to visit each website manually and download a precompiled version, or, if not available, download the source and compile the library themselves.

==Compiling xoreos==

Make you have your compiler, build system and libraries installed correctly. Then open a terminal and change into the directory of your sources.

===autotools===

Type

 <nowiki>./autogen.sh && ./configure && make</nowiki>

The binaries can then be found in the src subdirectory.

Optional, non-conventional ./configure flags:

{|
|
* --with-werror &nbsp;
|| Compile with -Werror
|-
|
* --without-warnings &nbsp;
|| Compile without the extra warnings enabled
|-
|
* --with-lto &nbsp;
|| Compile with link-time optimization
|}


===CMake ===

Type

 <nowiki>cmake . && make</nowiki>

The binaries can then be found in the bin subdirectory.

Please read [http://www.cmake.org/runningcmake/ Running CMake] on the CMake website for in-depth information on invoking CMake.

==Unit tests==

On both build systems,

 <nowiki>make check</nowiki>

compiles and runs our unit tests.
