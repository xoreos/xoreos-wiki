This page gives a few tips and pointers on how to compile xoreos-tools on various platforms.
__TOC__

==Compiler and build system==

xoreos-tools is written in C++, so a C++ compiler, like [https://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] or [http://clang.llvm.org/ clang] is required. It has two build systems: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system Autotools] ([https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ Autoconf], [https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/ Automake] and [https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ Libtool]) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake CMake]. Use whichever you feel more comfortable with.

===GNU/Linux===

On Debian-based distributions (including Ubuntu), you should be able to install the required compiler and build system packages with

 <nowiki>apt-get install libc6-dev g++ make autoconf automake libtool gettext</nowiki>

On other distributions, it should work similarily. 

===Windows===

Since Visual Studio does not work with autotools, you have to use the CMake build system if you want to compile xoreos with Visual Studio. If you're using [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW], however, you're free to choose either build system.

==Libraries==

xoreos-tools uses the following libraries to function:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconv iconv]
* [http://www.zlib.net/ zlib] (>= 1.2.3.4)
* [http://www.xmlsoft.org/ libxml2] (>= 2.8.0)
* [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] (>= 1.53.0)
** Boost.Utility
** Boost.StringAlgo
** Boost.System
** Boost.Filesystem
** Boost.Regex
** Boost.Hash
** Boost.Function
** Boost.Bind
** Boost.Uuid
** Boost.Smart_Ptr
** Boost.ScopeExit
** Boost.Atomic
** Boost.Locale

On Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution (including Ubuntu), you should be able to install these libraries and their development packages with

 apt-get install zlib1g-dev libxml2-dev libboost-all-dev

Other GNU/Linux distributions should work similarily. Windows users have to visit each website manually and download a precompiled version, or, if not available, download the source and compile the library themselves.

==Compiling xoreos==

Make you have your compiler, build system and libraries installed correctly. Then open a terminal and change into the directory of your sources.

===autotools===

Type

 <nowiki>./autogen.sh && ./configure && make</nowiki>

The binaries can then be found in the src subdirectory.

Optional, non-conventional ./configure flags:

{|
|
* --with-werror &nbsp;
|| Compile with -Werror
|-
|
* --without-warnings &nbsp;
|| Compile without the extra warnings enabled
|-
|
* --with-lto &nbsp;
|| Compile with link-time optimization
|}


===CMake ===

Type

 <nowiki>cmake . && make</nowiki>

The binaries can then be found in the bin subdirectory.

Please read [http://www.cmake.org/runningcmake/ Running CMake] on the CMake website for in-depth information on invoking CMake.
