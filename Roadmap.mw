== KotOR / KotOR 2 ==

Number one priority is to implement core gameplay of the original games, i.e., exploration, conversations/cutscenes, combat and GUI, which implies implementation of resource management, graphics, scripting, RPG and sound systems. Then goes the extra stuff, e.g., minigames, auxiliary menus, graphics improvements, networking, etc. Below is a rough list of features required to achieve feature parity with the original games and areas for improvement.
