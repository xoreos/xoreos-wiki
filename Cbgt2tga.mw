CBGT image to TGA converter

= Description =

'''cbgt2tga''' converts CBGT image files into common TGA images. CBGT, Compressed BackGround Tiles, are used as area background images in BioWare's Nintendo DS game [[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]].

Internally, a CBGT consists of a collection of 64x64 pixel cells, divided into tiles of 8x8 pixels. Each cell is compressed using Nintendo's 0x10 LZSS algorithm. Moreover, PAL files with the same name as the CBGT file contain the palette data, and 2DA files with the same name yet again contain the mapping of palette indices onto cells.

The width and height of the final image is not stored within the CBGT file, but the palette mapping 2DA does contain the number cells in X and Y direction, since it stores the palette indices in a two-dimensional array of those dimensions. Therefore, multi- plying the number of columns and rows in said 2DA by 64 yields the width and height, respectively, of the final image.
