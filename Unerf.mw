BioWare ERF (.erf, .mod, .nwm, .sav) archive extractor.

= Synopsis =

 unerf [<options>] <command> <archive> [<file> [...]]

= Description =

'''unerf''' extract BioWare ERF archives, found in many BioWare games as files with the extension .erf, .mod, .nwm or .sav. Moreover, in some games, a .rim file might be an ERF instead of a RIM.

There's several different versions of ERFs. This tool supports the version [https://github.com/xoreos/xoreos-docs/blob/master/specs/bioware/ERF_Format.pdf V1.0] ([[Neverwinter Nights]]), V1.1 ([[Neverwinter Nights 2]]), [http://social.bioware.com/wiki/datoolset/index.php/ERF#Version_2.0 V2.0] ([[Dragon Age: Origins]]), [http://social.bioware.com/wiki/datoolset/index.php/ERF#Version_2.2 V2.2] ([[Dragon Age: Origins]]) and [http://social.bioware.com/wiki/datoolset/index.php/ERF#Version_3.0 V3.0] ([[Dragon Age II]]).

'''Supported features:'''
* Archives with stripped filenames. The name hash is searched for in a big lookup table. If it is not found, the file is listed and extracted as a hexadecimal representation of the hash
* zlib-compressed files are supported and transparently decompressed
* Blowfish-encrypted archives are supported and are, provided you know the password, transparently decrypted
* Archives that contain full paths are supported. You can either strip the directory and extract the plain filenames, or substitute the directory separator with a '='
* Archives with numerical extension IDs belonging to different games can be aliased accordingly.

'''Unsupported features:'''
* XOR-encrypted archives
* Creating directories when extracting archives with full paths. Please also note that by stripped the directories of files in these archives, you might overwrite already extracted files
