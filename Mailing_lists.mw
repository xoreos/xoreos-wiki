The primary channel for important development-related discussion is the [[#xoreos-devel|xoreos-devel]] mailing list. All developers should subscribe to it.

There is one note about [[#xoreos-git|xoreos-git]]. Consider it as a read-only list, i.e. if you have comments/questions on someone's commit, post your follow-up to [[#xoreos-devel|xoreos-devel]].

If you use gmail, be advised that gmail sometimes puts emails coming from smaller servers, like xoreos.org, into the spam folder. There is unfortunately nothing that we can do about this. 

The full set of public lists are:

==xoreos-devel==
