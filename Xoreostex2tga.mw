= Description =

'''xoreostex2tga''' converts textures of various formats found in BioWare games into plain TGA images.

Supported formats:
* DDS: Both the common DirectDraw Surface format and BioWare's own, completely different DDS format are supported, each with a variety of pixel formats
* SBM: Found in Jade Empire, holding font glyphs
* TXB: Textures in Jade Empire and the Xbox version of Knights of the Old Republic
* TPC: Textures in other versions of Knights of the Old Republic.
* TGA: Textures in various games, in many different pixels formats

The output format is always either 24-bit or 32-bit BGR(A) TGA, depending on whether the input file has an alpha channel or not. Only the highest resolution mip map will be used.
