This page gives a few tips and pointers on how to compile xoreos on various platforms.
__TOC__

==Compiler and build system==

xoreos is written in C++, so a C++ compiler, like [https://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC] or [http://clang.llvm.org/ clang] is required. xoreos follows the C++14 standard. It has two build systems: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system Autotools] ([https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/ Autoconf], [https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/ Automake] and [https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/ Libtool]) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake CMake]. Use whichever you feel more comfortable with.

===GNU/Linux===

On Debian-based distributions (including Ubuntu), you should be able to install the required compiler and build system packages with

 <nowiki>sudo apt-get install libc6-dev g++ make autoconf automake libtool gettext cmake</nowiki>

On Arch Linux, you can install the necessary packages with

 <nowiki>sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake</nowiki>

On other distributions, it should work similarily.

===Mac OS X===

Due to the dependency on SDL2 (see below), you need at least Mac OS X 10.5 if you use a precompiled SDL2 library, and at least Mac OS X 10.7 if you're compiling SDL2 yourself.

===Windows===

Since Visual Studio does not work with autotools, you have to use the CMake build system if you want to compile xoreos with Visual Studio. If you're using [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW], however, you're free to choose either build system.

On Windows, it is recommended that instead of Visual Studio, you use [https://msys2.github.io/ MSYS2] together with [https://mingw-w64.org/ Mingw-w64] (which can produce both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries). MSYS2 provides a package manager, with which you can install xoreos' library dependencies very easily.

You can install the 32-bit toolchain in MSYS2 with

 <nowiki>pacman -S base-devel git mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-cmake</nowiki>

You can install the 64-bit toolchain in MSYS2 with

 <nowiki>pacman -S base-devel git mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake</nowiki>

==Libraries==

xoreos uses the following libraries to function:

* [https://www.webmproject.org/code/ libvpx] (>= 1.6.0)

On Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution (including Ubuntu), you should be able to install these libraries and their development packages with

 sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev libxml2-dev libboost-all-dev libsdl2-dev \
     libfreetype6-dev libopenal-dev libmad0-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libfaad-dev \
     libxvidcore-dev libvpx-dev

On Arch Linux, you can install these dependencies with

 sudo pacman -S zlib xz libxml2 boost boost-libs sdl2 freetype2 openal libmad libogg \
     libvorbis faad2 xvidcore libvpx

Other GNU/Linux distributions should work similarily.

On Windows, if you're using MSYS2, you can install these dependencies for 32-bit with

  pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-zlib mingw-w64-i686-xz mingw-w64-i686-libxml2 \
     mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-SDL2 mingw-w64-i686-freetype \
     mingw-w64-i686-openal mingw-w64-i686-libmad mingw-w64-i686-libogg \
     mingw-w64-i686-libvorbis  mingw-w64-i686-faad2 mingw-w64-i686-xvidcore \
     mingw-w64-i686-libvpx

On Windows, if you're using MSYS2, you can install these dependencies for 64-bit with

  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib mingw-w64-x86_64-xz mingw-w64-x86_64-libxml2 \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-freetype \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-openal mingw-w64-x86_64-libmad mingw-w64-x86_64-libogg \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-libvorbis  mingw-w64-x86_64-faad2 mingw-w64-x86_64-xvidcore \
     mingw-w64-x86_64-libvpx

Windows users not using MSYS2 will have to visit each website manually and download a precompiled version, or, if not available, download the source and compile the library themselves. Alternatively, vcpkg can be used to install most of these libraries.

=== A note on OpenAL ===

On Mac OS X, we're using Apple's OpenAL implementation, so OpenAL does not need to be installed separately there.

On both GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows, we require [http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html OpenAL Soft]. There is a propriety OpenAL implementation by Creative Labs, Inc. for Microsoft Windows, which can be found at [http://openal.org/ http://openal.org/], but it's unfortunately old, outdated and abandoned. We do not recommend its use.

Likewise, on NetBSD and other systems using pkgsrc, you should use [http://pkgsrc.se/audio/openal-soft openal-soft] instead of [http://pkgsrc.se/audio/openal openal].

==Compiling xoreos==

Make sure you have your compiler, build system and libraries installed correctly. Then open a terminal and change into the directory of your sources.

===autotools===

Type

 <nowiki>./autogen.sh && ./configure && make</nowiki>

The binary can be found in the src subdirectory, called "xoreos" or, on Windows, "xoreos.exe".

Optional, non-conventional ./configure flags:

{|
|
* --with-werror &nbsp;
|| Compile with -Werror
|-
|
* --without-warnings &nbsp;
|| Compile without the extra warnings enabled
|-
|
* --with-lto &nbsp;
|| Compile with link-time optimization
|-
|
* --disable-external-glew &nbsp;
|| Always compile against the internal GLEW libraries
|}

===CMake ===

Type

 <nowiki>cmake . && make</nowiki>

The binary can be found in the bin subdirectory, called "xoreos" or, on Windows, "xoreos.exe".

Please read [http://www.cmake.org/runningcmake/ Running CMake] on the CMake website for in-depth information on invoking CMake.

Optional, non-conventional cmake flags:

{|
|
* -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=on &nbsp;
|| Link Boost statically instead of dynamically
|-
|
* -DGLEW_INTERNAL=on &nbsp;
|| Always use internal GLEW library
|}

'''Note''': The CMake's stock FindBoost.cmake doesn't correctly detect dependencies when linking statically. In this case, xoreos might fail to link, missing symbols for ICU, when linking Boost statically.

Moreover, if you're running GNU/Linux and have wrapper scripts installed that force the building of "hardened" binaries (often called "hardening-wrapper", but differs between Linux distributions), compiling xoreos might fail during the linking stage, when using statically linking Boost libraries. This is due to those static Boost libraries being incompatible with the compiler option "-fPIE", which is often added by hardening wrapper scripts. A workaround is to disable -fPIE for this compilation (which is distribution-specific).

==Unit tests==

On both build systems,

 <nowiki>make check</nowiki>

compiles and runs our unit tests.

==Running xoreos==

Please have a look at the [[Running xoreos]] page.
