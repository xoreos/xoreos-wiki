BioWare KEY/BIF archive extractor

= Synopsis =

 unkeybif [<options>] <command> <file> [...]

= Description =

'''unkeybif''' extract BioWare KEY/BIF archives, found in many BioWare games.

KEY and BIF files are fundamentally linked: a KEY file contains file names and types, while the BIF file contains the file data itself. At the same time, a KEY file can control several BIF files.

'''For example:'''

"foo.key" controls:
* "foo1.bif"
* "foo2.bif"
* "foo3.bif"

"foo.key" indexes:
* "bar.are" and "bar.git" from "foo1.bif"
* "qux.utc" from "foo2.bif"
* "baz.txt" from "foo3.bif"

If you want to extract all files indexed by "foo.key", you need to also specify "foo1.bif", "foo2.bif" and "foo3.bif" on the command.  If "foo3.bif" is missing, "baz.txt" will not be extracted. However, listing file only requires the KEY.
