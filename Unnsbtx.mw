Nintendo NSBTX texture extractor

= Synopsis =

 unnsbtx [<options>] <command> <file>

= Description =

'''unnsbtx''' treats Nintendo NSBTX texture as archives and converts the multiple images stored within
into TGA files. The image pixel data and the palettes are automatically combined, provided they are
named similarly.

= Options =

'''-h''' <br />
'''--help'''
: Show a help text and exit.

'''--version'''
: Show version information and exit.

<command>
: '''l''' &nbsp; List images inside this NSBTX texture
: '''e''' &nbsp; Extract images as TGA files

<file>
: The NSBTX texture to read.

= Limitations =

The palette of an image has to be named similarly to the pixel data. Specifically, the palette has
to be either named the same, or suffixed by "_pl", "_p" or "_". Is this not the case, and a palette
for an image can't be found, unnsbtx throws an error.

= Examples =

List all images contained in the texture texture.nsbtx:
 unnsbtx l texture.nsbtx

Extract all images contained in the texture texture.nsbtx:
 unnsbtx e texture.nsbtx
