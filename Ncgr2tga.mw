Nintendo NCGR image to TGA converter

= Synopsis =

 ncgr2tga [<options>] <width> <height> <ncgr> [<ngr> [...]] <nclr> <tga>

= Description =

'''ncgr2tga''' converts Nintendo's tile-based NCGR images into common TGA images.

2D graphics on the Nintendo DS is fundamentally tile-based. Specifically, the graphics data in NCGR is ordered in tiles of 8x8 pixels. Moreover, an NCGR file can itself be a tile of a larger image. This tool can automatically combine and unwrap these tiles, and, together with an NCLR file for the palette, converts a grid of NCGR into a plain old linear TGA image.

= Options =

'''-h''' <br />
'''--help'''
: Show a help text and exit.

'''--version'''
: Show version information and exit.

<width>
: The width of the NCGR grid, in NCGR files.

<height>
: The height of the NCGR grid, in NCGR files.

<ncgr>
: The name of an NCGR file to use. The NCGR contains the pixel graphics part of the image.

: width x height NCGR files have to be given; they are drawn into the final TGA in row-major order. An empty filename, commonly specified with "", means that this grid cell will be empty, filled with palette entry 0.

<nclr>
: The name of the NCLR file to use. The NCLR file contains the palette part of the image.

<tga>
: The resulting TGA file will be written there.

= Limitations =

'''- '''Only NCGR files with version 1.1 are supported <br />
'''- '''Only NCLR files with version 1.0 are supported <br />
'''- '''Only palettes with bit-depths of 4 or 8 are supported <br />
'''- '''Non-tiled or partitioned NCGR files are not supported <br />
'''- '''Some NCGR files don't contain valid width/height values, and seem to need an NCER file for this information. These files are currently not supported <br />

= Examples =

Convert a 2x3 grid of NCGR files:
 ncgr2tga 2 3 a0.ncgr a1.ncgr a2.ncgr a3.ncgr a4.ncgr a5.ncgr a.nclr a.tga

Convert a 2x2 grid of NCGR files, leaving the lower left quadrant blank:
 ncgr2tga 2 2 b0.ncgr, b1.ncgr "" b2.ncgr b.nclr b.tga
