xoreos is an open source implementation of Bioware's Aurora engine and its derivatives, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 (or later).

In order to accurately reimplement these games, we need to research how all of the mechanics work. If you feel like crawling deep into the bowels of the Aurora engine, or have already done so, please feel free to document your newly gained understandings here.
