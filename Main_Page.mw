xoreos is an open source implementation of Bioware's Aurora engine and its derivatives.

It aims to have fully playable (and improved!) versions of the following games:

*[[Neverwinter Nights]]
*[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]
*[[Knights of the Old Republic]]
*[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]
*[[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]]
*[[The Witcher]]
*[[Dragon Age]]
*[[Dragon Age 2]]

For the status of each individual game, see their wiki page.

In order to accurately reimplement these games, we need to research how all of the mechanics work. Please add any research under gamename/Research (for example, [[Knights of the Old Republic/Research]])
