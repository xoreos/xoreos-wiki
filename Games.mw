xoreos aims to have fully playable (and improved!) versions of the following games:

*[[Neverwinter Nights]]
*[[Neverwinter Nights 2]]
*[[Knights of the Old Republic]]
*[[Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords]]
*[[Jade Empire]]
*[[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]]
*[[The Witcher]]
*[[Dragon Age: Origins]]
*[[Dragon Age II]]

For the status of each individual game, see their wiki page.

In order to accurately reimplement these games, we need to research how all of the mechanics work. Please add any research under gamename/Research.

*[[Neverwinter Nights/Research]]
*[[Neverwinter Nights 2/Research]]
