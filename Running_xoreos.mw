First, you need to fully install and/or copy the game you want to play with xoreos onto your hard disk. How you do this depends on the game, your operating system and where/how you have bought the game.

xoreos does not yet have a launcher GUI or anything like this. You need to start it from the command line. Run xoreos with the command line option "--help" (without the quotes) to get a [[#Command line parameters|help text about further command line options]].

The quickest way to start a game in path /path/to/game/ would be to call

 <nowiki>xoreos -p/path/to/game/</nowiki>

If you're on Windows and the path is, say, D:\Path\To\Game\, call

 <nowiki>xoreos -pD:\Path\To\Game\</nowiki>


==Config file==

In general, xoreos can read the configuration which game to run from either the command line, a config file or both. Additionally, when you first specify a new game on the command line, xoreos will add a related entry in the config file (creating it first, if necessary).

To accurately identify a specific instance of an installed game, xoreos uses the concept of a "target". Each target has a separate section in the config file, and each of their options apply only to that target. The special target "xoreos" is a global section applying to all games, although the same option in a game target overrides the global option.

The format of the config file is also relatively simple: It's in essence [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file an INI file]. Targets are enclosed in [] and options are assigned values with a =. Comments can begin with either a ";" or a "#" and run to the end of the line. When changing the file, xoreos will try to preserve all comments it encounters, so you don't need to fear about losing them.

For example:

 <nowiki># This is an example for a xoreos.conf file, where xoreos reads and
# saves game configuration options. xoreos expects this file in the
# user conf directory, whose location depends on the operating
# system.
#
# - On GNU/Linux, the place is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xoreos/xoreos.conf.
#   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to $HOME/.config/
# - On Mac OS X, the place is $HOME/Library/Preferences/xoreos/xoreos.conf
# - On Windows, xoreos.conf is in the subdirectory xoreos in either
#   $APPDATA or $USERPROFILE, depending on your Windows version
#
# You can also specify a different xoreos.conf with the command line
# option -c/--config.
#
# If the xoreos.conf does not exist, xoreos will create one with
# default values on the first successful game start.
#
# The encoding of this file *must* be UTF-8.
#
# When a setting is changed using the in-game menus, like the options
# menu in Neverwinter Nights, xoreos will save the changes back to the
# config file on exit, inside the section for the current game.
# Settings given on the command line are not saved back. When xoreos
# saves the config file, all unchanged settings and all comments in it
# will be preserved.
#
# The "xoreos" section is used for global configuration; the other
# sections are targets, entries to describe games. If the same setting
# exists in the global section and in the section for the current
# game, the setting in the game section overrides the global setting.
#
# The name of the game section is not used for game identification.
# As such, the name is arbitrary and up to the user. There are
# restrictions on the name, though: only these characters are allowed:
# [-_. A-Za-z0-9], i.e. alphanumerical characters plus hyphen,
# underscore, full stop and space. All section names have to be
# unique, too. Since the section name "xoreos" is already used for
# global options, it is not a valid game section name.
#
# The section names can be used to start xoreos with. This example
# file has a section called "nwn"; to start xoreos with that game, and
# automatically apply the settings in that "nwn" section (in addition
# to the global options), start xoreos with "nwn" as a command line
# option. Like so:
#
# xoreos nwn
#
# All setting keys are also valid command line options for xoreos, and
# vice versa. For example, you can start xoreos thusly:
#
# xoreos --width=800 --height=600 nwn
#
# This will start xoreos with Neverwinter Nights, with a window of
# size 800x600. These two added settings will not be saved to the
# config file. But if you then change the resolution in the options
# menu of Neverwinter Nights, xoreos will add width and height to the
# "nwn" section, with the values you selected inside the game.
#
# Moreover, if a give an option on the command line that already
# exists in the game section, it will override the setting in the game
# section, but only for this session. It will not save back to the
# config file. For example
#
# xoreos --largefonts=false nwn
#
# Will start Neverwinter Nights in xoreos with the small in-game
# conversation font, but this setting will not be remembered for the
# next time.

You can then start the game with the target "nwn" with

 <nowiki>xoreos nwn</nowiki>

and xoreos will do the rest. This will start the game in the path /home/drmccoy/games/nwn/, running it in fullscreen at 1024x768.

As you can see with the volume options, xoreos also saves settings you made in the game' actual GUI into the target's section of the config file.

  in the config file already.</nowiki>

Long-form command line option, like --skipvideos, map directly to config options. Options given on the command line will override any options found in the config file for this session, but will not save back to that config file.
