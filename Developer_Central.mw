The purpose of this page is to give a link to all kinds of resources that contain information valuable to current and future developers of xoreos.


== Getting started ==
* The first thing you need to be able to do is [[Git#Retrieving_the_code|get the xoreos code]] from our [[Git]] repository.
* Then you should [[Compiling xoreos|compile xoreos]].

That was easy, right? Here are some more tips:

* Before you write/submit code, '''you must read''' our [[Code Formatting Conventions]].<br>Patches which do not follow them will be rejected or at least delayed until they are cleaned up to comply to them.
* If you have write (push) access to our repository, you are expected to have read and to comply with our [[Commit Guidelines]].<br>Also, please read the tips for using Git here: [http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Git_tips Git tips].<br>In particular, note the use of feature branches, when working on refactoring or other large connected changes, rather than committing directly to xoreos/master.
* If you do not have write (push) access to our repository, you should submit your contributions by the following method:
** Using a [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests Github Pull Request].<br> This requires you to have/register a github account, fork our repository, commit your changes to a branch and then issue a Pull Request.<br>This is the current preferred method as it is easier for the team to review, discuss and amend prior to merging.<br>You are expected to have read and to comply with our [[Commit Guidelines]].

For people starting out with reverse engineering, here are a few useful resources:

* [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Game_File_Format_Central XentaxWiki] focuses on game file formats. They too have a [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=DGTEFF guide page]
* For audio and video formats, there's [http://wiki.multimedia.cx/ MultimediaWiki], which is associated with the ffmpeg and libav projects
